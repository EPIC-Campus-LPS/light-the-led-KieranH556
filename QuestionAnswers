1. What is the purpose of a Breadboard
The purpose of the breadboard is so that an individual can connect external hardware (Like LEDs and Sensors) powered and controlled by the Pi
2. Does the LED orientation matter?
Yes, the LED's orientation matters. The anode needs to be coneced to the positive side of power and the cathode on the negative, otherwise it will "break" the circut.
3. Why do you put a resistor in your circut?
To control the amount of power going into the LED, there is a larger amount of voltage the LED can handle so a reistor provides resistance so that the LED doesn't overheat/burn out.
4. How will a resistor with greater resistance affect the light
If there is greater resistance the light would be dimmer due to the lower amount of voltage.
